# FacialRecognition_Autonobots1

In this project you will build a password vault protected by Facial Recognition.
Whenever the program detects your face, you will be able to write and read passwords from a secured .txt file

There are three starter scripts included:

1. pictureTake.py: Takes photos at 1 second increments, useful for rapid data collection
2. FaceDetect.py: Detects if someone is in-front of the computer, you must provide your trained model
3. Classify.py: Pretrained classifier using a mobileNet
